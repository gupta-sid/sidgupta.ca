BFS

- Visit all nodes reachable from given node S

- look at nodes reachable in 
	0 moves (S)
	1 move 	(Adj[s])
	2, 3, ... , n moves
	
- careful to avoid duplicates


# graph is Adj
# s is starting node
BFS( s, Adj):

	level = {s: null}
	
	parent = {s: None}
	
	i = 1	
	
	
	frontier = [s]	#all nodes we can reach using i-1 moves (level i-1)
	
	while frontier:
	
		next = []	#all nodes we can reach using i (level i)
		
		for u in frontier:
			
			for v in Adj[u]:
				
				if v not in level:		#v is not in the level dictionary (not visited)
					
					level[v] = i
					
					parent[v] = u
					
					next.append(v)
		
		frontier = next
		i+=1

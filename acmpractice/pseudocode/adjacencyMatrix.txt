Graph representations

Adjacency lists:

- array Adj of size (vertexes.size())

- Adj is an array of LinkedLists

- for each Node u in vertexes:
	
	Adj[u] stores u's neighbors
		Adj[u] is the set of all neighbors v such that (u,v) is an edge
		


Your method of using OOP works too.

However, use adjacency matrix if you want to use the same vertexes on 
different graphs
